# WhatToDo UWP
WhatToDo is a tasklist app for Windows 10 which we're creating as a project for (vocational) school.

It'll use UWP (Universal Windows Platform), which means it will work on both, desktop computers and mobile phones.
Furthermore, we're using the Google Tasks API, so it'll synchronize with your tasks on Google Mail and any other application which uses this API.

For anyone who doesn't know what Google Tasks is, here's the link: https://mail.google.com/tasks/canvas?pli=1
And here's the link to the API: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/tasks/


**Important: Since this is our project for school, we will not accept any pull requests.**
